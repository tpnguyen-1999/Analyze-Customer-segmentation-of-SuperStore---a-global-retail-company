# [PYTHON] RFM Analysis

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. RFM Analysis
### Why RFM
- RFM is a marketing analysis technique that stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
  - **Recency**: measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
  - **Frequency**: measures how often a customer has made purchases.
  - **Monetary**: measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.
- RFM is used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and how recently and frequently they have made purchases, as well as the monetary value of those purchases.
- RFM could be very useful, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited marketing resources, helping them focus on the potentially right customer segments to increase ROI, reduce churn, reduce cost, improve customer relationship, and a lot more.

### How?
- In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores.
