# [PYTHON] RFM Analysis

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. RFM Analysis
### Why RFM
- RFM is a marketing analysis technique that stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
  - **Recency**: measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
  - **Frequency**: measures how often a customer has made purchases.
  - **Monetary**: measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.
- RFM is used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and how recently and frequently they have made purchases, as well as the monetary value of those purchases.
- RFM could be very useful, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited marketing resources, helping them focus on the potentially right customer segments to increase ROI, reduce churn, reduce cost, improve customer relationship, and a lot more.

### How?
- In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores.

### 1.2. Business context
SuperStore is a global retail company with a large customer base. For the upcoming Christmas and New Year season, the Marketing Department plans to run campaigns to show appreciation to customers who have supported the company over time, as well as to target potential customers who could become loyal.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to segment the customers for this year because the dataset is too large to manually process as done in previous years. Therefore, they have asked the Data Analytics Department for assistance in implementing a customer segmentation model to tailor marketing campaigns for each customer group.

The Marketing Director has suggested using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was smaller, the team could manually calculate and categorize customers using Excel. Now, with the growing volume of data, they would like the Data Department to develop a Python-based workflow to evaluate and segment customers.
